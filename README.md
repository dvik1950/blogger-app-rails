A simple blog created using rails

Created by following this tutorial : http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html which was recommended in the The Odin Project curriculum (theodinproject.com)

The point of this assigment is to get an idea of how Ruby on rails works,rather than actually making the whole app yourself. The tutorial has a nice way of explaining things while continuously forcing you to stay on track by asking you to do simple tasks during the development of the app.
